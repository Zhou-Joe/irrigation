"""Shared validation for user-uploaded media files.

Centralizes the allow-list and content-sniffing so every upload path
(web admin upload, DRF upload, workorder photo upload) applies the same
rules. Without this an attacker could upload `.html`/`.svg` files that,
served from the app origin under `/media/`, become stored-XSS payloads.

Two kinds of files are accepted:
  - Images: validated by actually decoding the bytes with Pillow (so a
    renamed `.exe` is rejected regardless of its name).
  - Videos: extension-only check (no ffmpeg-based content sniff here; the
    downstream `_make_video_thumbnail` is best-effort and tolerates fakes).
